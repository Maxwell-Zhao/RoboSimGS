# Installation

RoboSimGS codebase is built on top of [Genesis](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis) and [Lerobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot).  We are actively working on this section and will update it soon. ðŸš§


# Scene Reconstruction
## Background Reconstruction
We are actively working on this section and will update it soon. ðŸš§

## Object Reconstruction
As mentioned in our paper, the object reconstruction is performed using the 'AR Code' app on an iPhone 16 Pro. By scanning the object with the phone, we can obtain a high-quality mesh.

# Simulated Data Generation
We are actively working on this section and will update it soon. ðŸš§

# Policy Training
We are actively working on this section and will update it soon. ðŸš§


# Sim2Real Deployment
We are actively working on this section and will update it soon. ðŸš§
