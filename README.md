# Installation

RoboSimGS codebase is built on top of [Genesis](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis) and [Lerobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot).  We are actively working on this section and will update it soon. ðŸš§


# Scene Reconstruction
## Background Reconstruction
We reconstruct a 3D background scene using the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method within the [Nerfstudio](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio). For more in-depth information, always refer to the official Nerfstudio GitHub repository. The final output of this process will be a .ply file representing the 3D Gaussian Splatting scene, which can be viewed in compatible real-time renderers.

## Object Reconstruction
As mentioned in our paper, the object reconstruction is performed using the 'AR Code' app on an iPhone 16 Pro. By scanning the object with the phone, we can obtain a high-quality mesh.

**MLLM-driven Articulation Inference**. A comprehensive overview of the architecture is available in the [Document](Articulation/Articulation.md).

**MLLM-driven Physics Estimation**. A comprehensive overview of the architecture is available in the [Document](Articulation/Articulation.md).
